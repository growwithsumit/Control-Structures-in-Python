# Control-Structures-in-Python

## üìñ Overview

This repository features two fundamental Python programs demonstrating essential programming concepts: conditional logic (`if-else`) and iterative structures (`for` loops) for basic problem-solving. These projects are excellent examples for understanding how to handle user input, perform simple calculations, and control program flow.

## üöÄ Projects Included

This collection contains the following two Python scripts:

### 1. Even or Odd Checker (`even_or_odd.py`)

This script takes an integer as input from the user and determines whether that number is even or odd.

* **Features:**
    * Accepts a single integer input from the user.
    * Uses the modulo operator (`%`) and an `if-else` statement to check divisibility by 2.
    * Provides clear output indicating if the number is even or odd.
    * Includes basic error handling for non-integer inputs.
* **Concepts Demonstrated:**
    * User input (`input()`)
    * Type conversion (`int()`)
    * Conditional statements (`if-else`)
    * Modulo operator (`%`)
    * Error handling (`try-except`)
* **Example Usage & Output:**
    ```
    Enter a number: 42
    ‚úÖ 42 is an even number.
    ```
    ```
    Enter a number: 17
    ‚òëÔ∏è 17 is an odd number.
    ```
    ```

### 2. Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 (`sum_of_50_integers.py`)

This program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 up to and including 50 using a `for` loop.

* **Features:**
    * Initializes a `sum_total` variable to keep track of the accumulated sum.
    * Iterates through numbers from 1 to 50 using `range()`.
    * Adds each number in the sequence to the `sum_total`.
    * Prints the final, total sum after the loop completes.
* **Concepts Demonstrated:**
    * `for` loop for iteration
    * `range()` function
    * Variable initialization and accumulation
    * Basic arithmetic (`+` or `+=`)
* **Example Usage & Output:**
    ```
    The sum of all integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
    ```
